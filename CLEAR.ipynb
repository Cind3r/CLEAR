    "This is the notebook file primarily responsible for pre-processing data, attaching important information, and generating database files for the github page. Below you can find all information about how data is processed from the downloaded `.csv` files found on most hospital sites. This is an exploratory project focused on creating interactive visualzations and tools to better inform people about their healthcare. The repo can always be maintained by downloading the most current year data for the specific hospital and putting it through the scripts. It should be noted that this is NOT a comprehensive list, but it can potentially be scaled to a full working-standalone site with enough time. \n",

    "Hospitals that have been added to this 'web-app' are stored in a `.csv` file for quick look up and ease of access. This points to the loc of it's Charge Master `.json` file which is then queried for the specific procedure. Hospitals are gathered from the CSV list based on a radius look-up provided by the user. If a hospital in the radius does not offer the service, it will not display the price point compared to others in the radius. \n",
